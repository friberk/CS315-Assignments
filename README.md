# CS315 Assignments

**DISCLAIMER:** All the work here has been shared on GitHub to create an archive of materials from the CS315 course. You should not use those codes for your academic studies. Otherwise, you will do nothing but deceive yourself.

This repository consists of my solutions to every single work in Bilkent University CS315 course. During my junior year, I took the course from Prof. Dr. H. A. Güvenir in the 2022-2023 Fall Semester.

## Structure

All assignments are organized in the following order:

```txt

Projects/
├── Project 1/
└── Project 2/
    ├── ...

```

The corresponding instructions for every assignment can be found in the ``README.md`` file in their own folder.
